 **Name:** Lost and Found Map  
 **Language:** Swift  
 **OS:** IOS  
 
**Description:**  
The *Lost and Found Map* app is exclusively for students and restricted to campus locations, allowing users to report lost items like wallets, ID cards, and keys by pinning the location and providing detailed descriptions (e.g., color, brand, contents). When an item is reported, an alert is sent to all users and remains active until resolved. If someone finds the item, they fill in matching details; if verified, the owner is notified. A built-in chat feature enables direct communication between the finder and owner to arrange a meetup for item exchange.
